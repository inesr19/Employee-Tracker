# Employee Tracker

## Description

The purpose of this application is to allow the user to track employees using mySQL and inquirer. With this application, the user can add departments, roles, and employees for the company. They can also view all employees, roles, and departments as well as update employee information. At the start of the application, the user is prompted a series of options within the database. Once the user chooses if they want to add, view, or update they are then prompted with additional questions until they have inputted all of the necessary information for that selected section. In the end of the process, a table is generated in the Terminal with all of the information that the user requested or inputted.
